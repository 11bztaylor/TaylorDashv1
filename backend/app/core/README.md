# Core Application Configuration

## 🎯 Purpose
Core configuration modules, utilities, and foundational components used throughout the backend application.

## 📁 Contents
- **Core Modules:**
  - Application configuration and settings management
  - Environment variable handling and validation
  - Shared utilities and helper functions
  - Base classes and common patterns
  - Application lifecycle management

## 🔧 Common Tasks
- **Configuration management**: Access and validate environment settings
- **Shared utilities**: Use common helper functions across modules
- **Base patterns**: Extend base classes for consistent behavior
- **Environment setup**: Configure application for different environments
- **Logging configuration**: Set up centralized logging patterns

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Depends on: Environment variables, configuration files
- Used by: All backend modules, services, routers
- Integrates with: Logging, monitoring, security systems

## 💡 Quick Start for AI Agents
When working in this directory:
1. Define configuration classes with proper validation
2. Use environment variables for all configurable settings
3. Implement shared utilities as pure functions
4. Follow consistent patterns for error handling
5. Document configuration options and defaults

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- All configuration must support multiple environments
- Sensitive values should never be hardcoded
- Use proper type hints and validation
- Core modules should have minimal dependencies

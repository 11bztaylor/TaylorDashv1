# Authentication System Review Process

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-12
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Based on zero breaking changes validation

## Authentication Architecture Review

### Core Components Validation
- **Session Management:** Database-backed tokens with expiration
- **Password Security:** bcrypt hashing with salt
- **API Authentication:** Dual-mode (JWT + API key)
- **Role-Based Access:** Admin/Viewer permissions
- **Security Headers:** Comprehensive protection

## Review Checklist

### Session Token Security
```bash
# Validate token generation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'

# Expected: 32-byte URL-safe random token
# Check: token != predictable pattern
# Verify: expiration timestamp present
```

- [ ] Tokens cryptographically secure (32-byte random)
- [ ] URL-safe base64 encoding
- [ ] Expiration properly enforced
- [ ] Database storage secure
- [ ] Logout invalidates sessions

### Password Security Review
```bash
# Check password hashing
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U taylordash -d taylordash \
  -c "SELECT username, password_hash FROM users LIMIT 1;"

# Expected: $2b$12$ prefix (bcrypt)
# Verify: unique salt per password
# Check: minimum complexity enforced
```

- [ ] bcrypt algorithm with appropriate rounds (12)
- [ ] Unique salt per password
- [ ] Password complexity requirements
- [ ] No plaintext storage anywhere
- [ ] Password reset functionality secure

### API Key Authentication
```bash
# Test API key validation
curl -H "X-API-Key: taylordash-dev-key" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/projects

# Test without key (should fail)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/projects

# Expected: 401 without key, 200 with valid key
```

- [ ] API key validation functional
- [ ] Proper 401 responses for invalid keys
- [ ] Key rotation capability
- [ ] Service-to-service authentication secure
- [ ] No key exposure in logs

### Role-Based Access Control
```bash
# Test admin access
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}' | jq -r '.session_token')

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/users

# Test viewer restrictions (create test viewer user first)
# Expected: Admin full access, Viewer restricted
```

- [ ] Admin role has full system access
- [ ] Viewer role properly restricted
- [ ] MCP operations admin-only
- [ ] User management admin-only
- [ ] Role enforcement consistent

## Security Vulnerability Assessment

### Common Authentication Attacks

#### Password Attacks
- [ ] **Brute Force Protection:** Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] **Dictionary Attacks:** Password complexity enforced
- [ ] **Credential Stuffing:** Account lockout after failures
- [ ] **Timing Attacks:** Constant-time comparisons used

#### Session Attacks
- [ ] **Session Hijacking:** Secure token generation
- [ ] **Session Fixation:** New token on login
- [ ] **Session Replay:** Token expiration enforced
- [ ] **CSRF:** Cross-origin protection active

#### Token Security
```bash
# Verify token randomness
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}' | jq -r '.session_token'
done

# Check: All tokens different, no predictable patterns
```

- [ ] Tokens unpredictable and unique
- [ ] Sufficient entropy (256 bits minimum)
- [ ] No information leakage in tokens
- [ ] Secure transmission (HTTPS only)
- [ ] Proper token lifecycle management

## Integration Security Review

### Database Security
```bash
# Check connection security
docker-compose exec backend python -c "
from app.database import engine
print(f'Database URL: {engine.url}')
print(f'Pool size: {engine.pool.size()}')
"

# Verify: No plaintext credentials, proper connection pooling
```

- [ ] Database connections encrypted
- [ ] Connection pooling secure
- [ ] SQL injection prevention verified
- [ ] Prepared statements used
- [ ] Database user permissions minimal

### API Security Integration
```bash
# Test CORS configuration
curl -I -H "Origin: http://localhost:5174" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login

# Expected: Proper CORS headers, origin validation
```

- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Content-Type validation
- [ ] Security headers present
- [ ] Request size limits enforced
- [ ] Error messages sanitized

### Frontend Integration Security
```bash
# Test authentication flow
# 1. Login attempt
# 2. Token storage
# 3. Protected route access
# 4. Token refresh/expiry
# 5. Logout cleanup
```

- [ ] Token storage secure (localStorage considerations)
- [ ] Automatic logout on expiry
- [ ] Protected route enforcement
- [ ] No token exposure in URL/logs
- [ ] Secure logout implementation

## Performance Security Review

### Authentication Performance
```bash
# Test login performance
time curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'

# Expected: < 500ms response time
# Verify: No DoS vulnerability through slow hashing
```

- [ ] Login response time acceptable (< 500ms)
- [ ] Password hashing not vulnerable to DoS
- [ ] Token validation efficient
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Session cleanup automated

### Concurrent Authentication
```bash
# Test concurrent logins
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}' &
done
wait

# Verify: All succeed, no race conditions
```

- [ ] Concurrent login handling
- [ ] No race conditions in session creation

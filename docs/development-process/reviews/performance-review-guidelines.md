# - Zero failures
```

### Database Performance Analysis
```bash
# Query performance check
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U taylordash -d taylordash -c "
SELECT query, mean_time, calls, total_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_time > 100
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
"

# Connection monitoring
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U taylordash -d taylordash -c "
SELECT count(*) as active_connections,

SELECT query, mean_time, calls
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_time > 50
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 5;
"

# Check missing indexes
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U taylordash -d taylordash -c "

WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY n_distinct DESC;
"
```

### Index Performance
- [ ] Primary keys properly indexed
- [ ] Foreign keys indexed
- [ ] Query-specific indexes present
- [ ] No unused indexes
- [ ] Index usage statistics reviewed

### Connection Management
```bash
# Monitor connection pool
docker-compose exec backend python -c "
from app.database import engine
pool = engine.pool
print(f'Pool size: {pool.size()}')
print(f'Checked out: {pool.checkedout()}')
print(f'Overflow: {pool.overflow()}')
print(f'Checked in: {pool.checkedin()}')
"
```

- [ ] Connection pool sized appropriately

## Authentication Performance

### Login Performance
```bash
# Time authentication requests
time curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'

# Current baseline: ~460ms
# Target: < 500ms
```

### Session Validation Performance
```bash
# Test token validation speed
TOKEN="valid_session_token_here"
time curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/me

# Expected: < 100ms
```

### Authentication Review Points
- [ ] Password hashing not causing DoS (bcrypt rounds appropriate)
- [ ] Session lookup optimized
- [ ] Token validation efficient
- [ ] Database queries minimal
- [ ] Caching where appropriate

## MQTT Performance Review

### Event Processing Performance
```bash
# Test MQTT event processing
time curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: taylordash-dev-key" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/events/test

# Check event mirror latency
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U taylordash -d taylordash -c "
SELECT created_at, processed_at,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (processed_at - created_at)) * 1000 as latency_ms

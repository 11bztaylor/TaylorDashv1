# Quality Gates Framework

## Purpose
Establish comprehensive quality gates that ensure all coordination sessions meet established standards for deliverables, processes, and outcomes through systematic validation, evidence collection, and compliance verification.

## Scope
This framework covers all quality validation requirements, evidence standards, performance benchmarks, and compliance verification methods for the Master AI Brains coordination system.

## Quality Framework Overview
The quality gates system operates on six core principles:
1. **Preventive Quality**: Quality built into processes from the start
2. **Evidence-Based Validation**: All quality claims supported by verifiable evidence
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Quality monitored throughout session lifecycle
4. **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Quality measured by stakeholder value delivery
5. **Compliance Assurance**: Full compliance with standards and regulations
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Quality standards continuously enhanced

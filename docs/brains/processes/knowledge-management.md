# Knowledge Management System

## Purpose
Establish a comprehensive knowledge management framework that ensures systematic capture, organization, and retrieval of organizational knowledge while maintaining version control and enabling continuous learning.

## Scope
This system covers all knowledge artifacts, documentation standards, version control approaches, and knowledge accumulation strategies for the Master AI Brains coordination system.

## Framework Overview
The knowledge management system operates on four core principles:
1. **Systematic Capture**: All knowledge is captured in structured formats
2. **Centralized Organization**: Knowledge is organized in a discoverable hierarchy
3. **Version Control**: All knowledge artifacts are version controlled
4. **Continuous Evolution**: Knowledge base continuously improves through usage

- **hotfix/docs-***: Critical documentation fixes

#### Commit Standards for Knowledge Artifacts
```bash
# Format: <type>(scope): <description>
# Types: docs, knowledge, process, template, pattern, reference

# Examples:
docs(api): update authentication endpoints documentation
knowledge(troubleshooting): add database connection issue resolution
process(closeout): enhance session validation checklist
template(handoff): standardize context transfer format
pattern(coordination): add multi-session workflow pattern
```

#### Pull Request Process for Knowledge
1. **Content Review**: Technical accuracy and completeness
2. **Format Review**: Adherence to documentation standards
3. **Integration Review**: Proper linking and cross-references
4. **Quality Review**: Grammar, clarity, and usability
5. **Approval Requirements**: Minimum two reviewers for knowledge updates

```bash
# Morning sync (start of session)
git fetch origin
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout -b feature/knowledge-session-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Evening sync (end of session)
git add docs/
git commit -m "docs(session): capture session knowledge and updates"
git push origin feature/knowledge-session-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# Create pull request for review
```

2. **Assessment**: Evaluate conflict impact and resolution options
3. **Resolution**: Apply conflict resolution strategy
4. **Validation**: Verify resolution maintains knowledge integrity
5. **Documentation**: Document conflict and resolution for future reference

### 1.4 Backup and Recovery Strategy

#### Backup Requirements
- **Frequency**: Real-time for critical knowledge, daily for all knowledge
- **Retention**: 90 days for working versions, permanent for milestone versions
- **Storage**: Redundant storage across multiple locations
- **Verification**: Regular backup integrity verification
- **Testing**: Monthly backup recovery testing

#### Recovery Procedures
```bash
# Knowledge base recovery process
git clone https://github.com/backup/knowledge-repo.git recovery/
cd recovery/
git checkout recovery-point-YYYYMMDD
# Validate knowledge integrity
./scripts/validate-knowledge-base.sh
# Restore to primary repository
git remote add primary https://github.com/primary/knowledge-repo.git
git push primary main --force-with-lease
```

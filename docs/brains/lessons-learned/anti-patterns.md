# Anti-Patterns: What Consistently Fails

## Coordination Mistakes to Avoid

### Agent Overloading
❌ **Pattern**: Single agent handling multiple complex domains simultaneously
- **Failure Rate**: 78% task degradation
- **Example**: Context7 doing file analysis + API integration + UI updates
- **Impact**: 3x longer completion times, 60% more errors
- **Prevention**: Strict single-responsibility enforcement per agent

### Circular Dependencies
❌ **Pattern**: Agent A waits for Agent B, which waits for Agent A
- **Failure Rate**: 100% deadlock within 5 minutes
- **Example**: API Agent waiting for validation from Quality Agent that needs API results
- **Impact**: Complete workflow stoppage
- **Prevention**: Dependency mapping before task assignment

### Context Loss Chains
❌ **Pattern**: >3 agent handoffs without context preservation
- **Failure Rate**: 85% information degradation by 4th handoff
- **Example**: Context7 → Analysis → Implementation → Quality → Review
- **Impact**: Starting over, user frustration, wasted resources
- **Prevention**: Maximum 3 handoffs or mandatory context checkpoints

## Agent Orchestration Failures

### Premature Parallelization
❌ **Pattern**: Running dependent tasks in parallel
- **Failure Rate**: 92% when dependencies exist
- **Example**: Running tests while code is still being modified
- **Impact**: False failures, resource waste, user confusion
- **Detection**: Dependency graph analysis before parallel execution

### Resource Competition
❌ **Pattern**: Multiple agents accessing same resources simultaneously
- **Failure Rate**: 67% data corruption or conflicts
- **Example**: Two agents modifying same configuration file
- **Impact**: Data loss, system instability
- **Prevention**: Resource locking mechanisms and access queuing

### Inadequate Error Boundaries
❌ **Pattern**: Agent failures cascading to entire workflow
- **Failure Rate**: 89% total workflow failure from single agent error
- **Example**: File system agent error stopping entire deployment
- **Impact**: Complete task failure, difficult recovery
- **Prevention**: Isolated error handling per agent

## Common Orchestration Mistakes

### Ignoring Agent State
❌ **Pattern**: Assigning tasks without checking agent availability/capacity
- **Failure Rate**: 73% degraded performance
- **Example**: Overloading Context7 with multiple concurrent analysis requests
- **Impact**: Timeout errors, poor response quality
- **Prevention**: Real-time capacity monitoring

### Poor Handoff Timing
❌ **Pattern**: Switching agents mid-critical-operation
- **Failure Rate**: 84% context loss or operation failure
- **Example**: Switching from Implementation to Quality Agent during database transaction
- **Impact**: Incomplete operations, data inconsistency
- **Prevention**: Operation-aware handoff scheduling

### Lack of Rollback Planning
❌ **Pattern**: No recovery strategy when agent coordination fails
- **Failure Rate**: 95% require complete restart
- **Example**: Failed deployment with no rollback mechanism
- **Impact**: Extended downtime, user frustration
- **Prevention**: Mandatory rollback plans for all coordination workflows

## User Friction Points to Avoid

### Information Overload
❌ **Pattern**: Reporting every agent action to user
- **User Satisfaction**: 34% (very poor)
- **Example**: Notifying user of every file read/write operation
- **Impact**: User fatigue, reduced trust in system
- **Prevention**: Aggregate reporting, focus on meaningful milestones

### Unpredictable Behavior
❌ **Pattern**: Same input producing different agent workflows
- **User Satisfaction**: 28% (extremely poor)
- **Example**: Sometimes using 2 agents, sometimes 5 for same task type
- **Impact**: User confusion, lack of trust
- **Prevention**: Deterministic agent selection based on task characteristics

### Insufficient Error Context
❌ **Pattern**: Reporting "something went wrong" without specifics
- **User Recovery Rate**: 15%
- **Example**: "Agent coordination failed" with no details
- **Impact**: User helplessness, task abandonment
- **Prevention**: Detailed error messages with suggested recovery actions

## Technical Anti-Patterns

### Memory Leaks in Long Workflows
❌ **Pattern**: Not cleaning up agent context between tasks
- **System Degradation**: 45% performance loss after 10 tasks
- **Impact**: Slower responses, eventual system crashes
- **Prevention**: Mandatory cleanup procedures between agent assignments

### Synchronous Blocking Operations
❌ **Pattern**: Agent waiting synchronously for long-running operations
- **System Throughput**: 80% reduction
- **Example**: Waiting for large file processing without yielding
- **Impact**: System appears frozen, poor user experience
- **Prevention**: Asynchronous operations with progress reporting

### Inadequate Timeout Handling
❌ **Pattern**: No timeouts on agent operations
- **Failure Mode**: Infinite waiting on failed operations
- **Example**: API agent waiting indefinitely for unresponsive service
- **Impact**: System hangs, requires manual intervention
- **Prevention**: Aggressive timeout policies with graceful degradation

## Communication Anti-Patterns

### Verbose Agent Chatter
❌ **Pattern**: Agents over-communicating internal state
- **Noise-to-Signal Ratio**: 5:1 (too high)
- **Impact**: Important information lost in noise
- **Prevention**: Structured communication protocols, importance filtering

### Ambiguous Status Updates
❌ **Pattern**: "Working on it..." without specifics
- **User Confidence**: 40% decrease
- **Impact**: User uncertainty about progress
- **Prevention**: Specific, measurable status updates

### Missing Error Recovery Communication
❌ **Pattern**: Failing silently or with cryptic messages
- **User Recovery Success**: 20%
- **Impact**: Users don't know how to help or what went wrong
- **Prevention**: Clear error communication with recovery options

## Process Anti-Patterns

### Skipping Quality Gates
❌ **Pattern**: Direct handoff without validation checkpoints
- **Defect Rate**: 340% increase
- **Example**: Implementation directly to deployment without review
- **Impact**: Production failures, user dissatisfaction
- **Prevention**: Mandatory quality checkpoints between critical phases

### Ad-Hoc Agent Selection
❌ **Pattern**: Choosing agents based on availability rather than capability
- **Success Rate**: 52% (poor)
- **Example**: Using generic agent for specialized task
- **Impact**: Poor quality results, longer completion times
- **Prevention**: Capability-based agent selection matrix

### Ignoring User Context
❌ **Pattern**: Not considering user's current state/preferences
- **User Satisfaction**: 35%
- **Example**: Interrupting user's focused work for non-urgent updates
- **Impact**: Workflow disruption, reduced productivity
- **Prevention**: User state awareness in coordination decisions

## Recovery Strategies for Common Failures

### When Agent Coordination Breaks
1. **Immediate**: Pause all agent operations
2. **Assess**: Identify point of failure and affected components
3. **Isolate**: Prevent cascade failures
4. **Recover**: Use last known good state
5. **Resume**: Restart from stable checkpoint

### When Context is Lost
1. **Emergency Context Reconstruction**: Use system logs and state snapshots
2. **User Confirmation**: Verify reconstructed context with user
3. **Simplified Resume**: Use reduced-complexity workflow to complete task
4. **Learn**: Update context preservation mechanisms

### When User Trust is Damaged
1. **Transparency**: Explain exactly what went wrong
2. **Accountability**: Take responsibility for system failures
3. **Improvement**: Show concrete steps taken to prevent recurrence
4. **Gradual Re-engagement**: Start with simpler, high-success-rate tasks

- Plugin API access integrates with user authentication system  
- Authenticated users can install/manage plugins with proper authorization
- Plugin security framework works with session-based authentication
- Tablet/kiosk mode compatibility with plugin system maintained

**Technical Requirements**:
- Update plugin API endpoints to use session authentication alongside API keys
- Implement plugin permission system based on user roles
- Test plugin installation flow with authenticated admin users
- Verify plugin iframe sandboxing works with authenticated sessions

### 2. **MCP Manager Plugin Integration Testing** 
**Status**: Plugin in development on separate machine  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Coordination needed with plugin development  
**Task**: Prepare main system for MCP Manager plugin testing  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Plugin installation system compatible with authenticated users
- MCP Manager plugin installation from GitHub works with user permissions
- Real-time MQTT integration maintains authentication requirements  
- Plugin functionality accessible to appropriate user roles
- Documentation updated for authenticated plugin workflows

**Coordination Requirements**:
- Align plugin development with authentication system capabilities
- Test plugin installation API with authenticated admin users
- Validate plugin security with new authentication layer
- Ensure plugin data access respects user role permissions

### 3. **Authentication System Polish** - COMPLETE ✅
**Status**: 100% complete - All critical issues resolved  
**Priority**: COMPLETE - All functionality validated and operational  
**Task**: All authentication system components fully functional  

**Completed Items**:
- ✅ Edit user functionality working (setEditingUser state enabled)
- ✅ User list API response format corrected  
- ✅ Session timeout handling implemented and tested
- ✅ All CRUD operations functional (create, edit, delete users)
- ✅ Session management with proper token storage and validation
- ✅ Role-based access control working correctly
- ✅ Backend-frontend integration confirmed working

## Medium Term (Next 3-5 Sessions)

### 4. **Advanced Plugin Features with Authentication**
- Plugin marketplace with user-specific recommendations
- Plugin data isolation based on user roles  
- Plugin permission granularity (read/write/admin access)
- Plugin usage analytics for authenticated users

### 5. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Advanced dashboard features with authentication context
- User-specific project views and permissions
- Real-time collaboration features with user identification
- Enhanced tablet/kiosk mode with plugin integration

### 6. **Multi-Tenant Plugin Architecture**
- Plugin data segregation by user
- User-specific plugin configurations
- Plugin sharing and collaboration features
- Advanced security for plugin data access

## Plugin Development Coordination

### **MCP Manager Plugin Status**
- **Development Location**: Separate machine (coordination required)
- **Integration Readiness**: TaylorDash system ready for plugin testing
- **Security Requirements**: Plugin must work with new authentication system
- **Testing Plan**: Install and validate with authenticated admin users

### **Plugin Security with Authentication**
- Plugin API endpoints now require user authentication
- Plugin installations logged against authenticated users
- Plugin permissions system integrates with user roles
- Plugin data access controlled by user session validation

### **Documentation Updates Needed**
- Plugin installation with authentication workflows
- User role permissions for plugin management
- Plugin security guidelines with authentication
- MCP Manager plugin setup with authenticated system

## Success Metrics for Next Session

### **Critical Success Criteria**:
1. **Plugin-Auth Integration**: Plugins work seamlessly with authenticated users
2. **User Role Security**: Plugin permissions properly enforce admin/viewer restrictions  
3. **System Stability**: Existing functionality maintained with authentication
4. **Documentation Current**: All authentication + plugin workflows documented

### **Quality Gates**:
- All plugin API endpoints work with session authentication
- Admin users can install/manage plugins with proper authorization
- Viewer users appropriately restricted from plugin management
- Plugin security validation works with authenticated sessions
- System performance maintained with authentication overhead

## Strategic Direction

### **Current Milestone**: Authentication Foundation Complete ✅
- Enterprise-grade user authentication system operational
- Role-based access control implemented and tested
- Professional UI/UX with tablet mode support
- Production-ready security with comprehensive audit logging

### **Next Milestone**: Authenticated Plugin Ecosystem
- Plugin system enhanced with user role integration
- MCP Manager plugin operational with authenticated users
- Advanced plugin permissions and security validation
- Plugin marketplace foundation with user-specific features

### **Future Vision**: Collaborative Platform
- Multi-user project collaboration with plugin ecosystem
- Advanced dashboard with user-specific views and permissions
- Real-time collaboration features with plugin integration
- Enterprise-ready platform for team project management

## Immediate Actions for Next Session

1. **Start Here**: Test plugin installation API with authenticated admin users
2. **Validate**: Ensure plugin security framework works with user sessions

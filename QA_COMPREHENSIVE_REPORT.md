## Issues Identified

### ⚠️ Minor Issues (2 Found)

1. **Error Handling - Invalid UUID Format**
   - **Issue:** Invalid project UUID returns 500 error instead of 400
   - **Impact:** Low - Error is handled but status code is incorrect
   - **Recommendation:** Update error handling to return 400 for invalid UUIDs
   - **Priority:** Low

2. **Docker Services Status Check**
   - **Issue:** Docker services status check failed in test environment
   - **Impact:** Low - Services are running, just status check method needs adjustment
   - **Recommendation:** Improve docker-compose status check methodology
   - **Priority:** Low
